Hi, I have created the WordPress custom theme where I have made changes as per the task.

"
Create a shop site WITHOUT using plugin:
3 Pages -
1.) Categories page - which will display all products categories.
2.) Products page - on clicking on category from above page, all products from that category. This page should have filters options.
3.) Product detail page - This will have image, title, description, category, price, color.
"

To check this flow we need to add this theme into the wordpress site, and need to follow some steps for reflecting the changes:
- After adding and activating the theme, **we need to create the page and assigned the template named as Category-Page**, on this template I have showed the categories that will be define in the Custom Post Type
  named as Products.
- Then we can change our site Home page to the category page from the settings/reading tab, selects the static page and select Category Page.

# Functionality
- After creating categries, products. We can check the flow:
    - We have all categories(including the empty Categories) on the Category Page.
    - After selecting the category we will get the all products associated to that category with the color filter option on that page.
    - After this, we can select the product and will get all the information of that product.
 
Thanks
